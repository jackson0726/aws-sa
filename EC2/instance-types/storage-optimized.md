# Storage Optimized

- Great when you are accessing a lot of data sets on the local storage:
+ High-frequency online transactional processing, so OLTP systems.
+ Relational and NoSQL databases.
+ Cache for in-memory databases, for example, Redis.
+ Data warehousing application.
+ Distributed file systems.
