# IAM: Users, Groups, Policies

- Root Account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared.
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped.
- Groups only contain users, not other groups.
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and users can belong to mulple groups.

# Permissions:

- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
- Policies define the permissions of the users.
- In AWS, you apply the least privilege principle: don't give more permissions than a user needs.
