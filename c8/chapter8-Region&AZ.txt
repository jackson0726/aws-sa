AWS Global Infrastructure:
- AWS Regions
  + A region is a cluster of data centers
- AWS Availability Zones
- AWS Data Centers
- AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence


* How to choose an AWS Regions?
- Depends on Compliance with data governance(quản trị dữ liệu) and legal requirements: data never leaves a region(local region) without your explicit permission.
- Proximity(gần: time & space) to customers: reduced latency (network,...)
- Available services within a Region: new services and new features are not available in every Region (Not all Regions have ALL services)
- Pricing: pricing varies(thay đổi) region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page


* AWS Availability Zones:
- Each region has many Availability Zones: usually=3, min=3, max=6
- Ex: 
  + Region: Sydney: ap-southeast-2 
  + AZs: ap-southeast-2a, ap-southeast-2b and ap-southeast-2c
  + a AZ has: 1 or more data centers.
- They are separate from earch other, isolated from disasters.
- They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.
